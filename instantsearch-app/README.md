## Algolia Assessment

I started by uploading a few different datasets and indexing the data inside the Algolia Dashboard. This gave me a good view of the information, attributes, and assets I would work with as I built the UI. It revealed to me how important the structure and attributes of the dataset were. I added Searchable attributes based on the data set to start, then created the instantsearch-app using VS Code. I used the Algolia documentation and watched the embedded videos to understand how to approach building and adding to the UI. I wanted to make a simple yet powerful search UI for the dataset with brand filtering or a refinement list, a hierarchical menu for further categorization, sorting with relevant sorts, pagination, etc. Whenever I wanted to add something, I could go into the documentation and get my answer, along with just looking in the code to see what was available to me (and also generate UI demos in the dashboard). This led me to, among other things, enhance the UI by transforming items on the page to make it cleaner and better for the user. I wanted to make sure filtering by brand and category was easy. At the same time, it clearly kept track of what was being filtered, making searching much more effortless. Then, I added the sorting widget to test sorting the dataset alphabetically or by rating.

A big takeaway from this assignment was getting used to the dashboard, the significant number of actions and areas you can manage from one place, and adding widgets to the code to enhance the interface. As an SE, if I'm going to sell the value of what Algolia can provide, I need to get the experience by getting my hands dirty and doing it myself. The excellent documentation contains examples and explanations to help you accomplish your needs. Some concepts took longer than others, and there are so many others that I could dive into. I wanted to respect the time constraints put on this assignment. Still, if I were to have unlimited time, I would have liked to look into autocomplete, typo-tolerance, and personalization. I see the need for an SE to help customers/non-customers see the possibilities of accomplishing their goals and giving users of their site a better overall experience to find what they're looking for AND MORE.
